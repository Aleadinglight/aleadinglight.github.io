<h1>Welcome to my homepage</h1><br>

<p>My name is Nguyen Huu Tam. I am a programmer in Vaasa, Finland.
    I have fallen in love with coding since the very beginning of my school's life.
    Which lead to a result that I get to know and experience a lot of coding languages and system design.
    I am proficient in C++, Python and Javascript. Familiar with many technologies such as: Deep learning,
    Machine learnign, Web hosting, Web development, Git, Internet of things, Software development, ...
</p><br>
<p>
    However I still don't believe I have ever learnt enough that is why I am always available 
    for new positions and challenges.

    atleast once in a while.
    So if you decide to know more about me, please head to my Projects page.
