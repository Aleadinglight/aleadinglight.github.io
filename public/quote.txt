Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans.
Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen.
No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.
Any fool can know. The point is to understand. Albert Einstein
“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving.” – Albert Einstein
